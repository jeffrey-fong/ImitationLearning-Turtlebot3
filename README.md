# Imitation Learning with Turtlebot 3
This is an imitation learning implementation that contains both the DAgger and standard supervised learning algorithms. The main task is to train a neural network policy that allows the robot to navigate in the turtlebot3_house gazebo environment from room A to room B in the following figure:

Turtlebot 3 DAGGER main task is to train a neural network with the imitation learning Dagger algorithm. It uses the turtlebot_3_autorace as master policy and run in a gazebo simulated environment.
